# Message-Digest-5-C
An implementation of the Message Digest 5 algorithm in C.

## Project Brief

* Write a program in the C programming language that calculates the MD5 hash digest of an input. The algorithm is specified in the [Request For Comments 1321 document][RFC-1321] supplied by the [Internet Engineering Task Force][IETF].
* The program must perform the algorithm correctly  - it is up to the developer to decide which types of input the algorithm operates on, e.g. filename, string, url, etc.

## Background

The Message Digest (MD) algorithms are a family of [one way hash functions][One-Way-Hash-Functions]. A one way hash function, as described by [Professor Alan Kaminsky][One-Way-Hash-Functions]:

"maps an arbitrary-length input message M to a fixed-length output hash H(M) such that the following properties hold":

1. **One-way:** Given a hash H(M), it is difficult to find the message M.
2. **Second preimage resistant:** Given a message M1, it is difficult to find another message M2 such that H(M1) = H(M2).
3. **Collision resistant:** It is difficult to find two messages M1 and M2 such that H(M1) = H(M2).

Each of the algorithms in the MD family were designed by [Ronald Rivest][RonaldRivest], a cryptographer and professor at MIT. 

### History of Message Digest Algorithms

| Year  | Description |
|:-     |:-|
| 1989 | [MD2][RFC-1319] developed and optimised for 8-bit computers. |
| 1990 | [MD4][RFC-1320] developed.
| 1991 | [MD5][RFC-1321] designed. designed Den Boer and Bosselaers demonstrate weaknesses of MD4 in a paper published in 1991.
| 1992 | [RFC-1321][RFC-1321] published by Rivest, specifying the MD5 algorithm.
| 1995 | The first full-round MD4 collision attack was found by Hans Dobbertin, which took only seconds to carry out at that time. A preimage attack is theorised as being possible.
| 1996 | Collision of MD5 compression function announced. While not an attack on the complete MD5 function, cryptographers recommend switching to an alternative.
| 2004 | MD2 shown to be vulnerable to a preimage attack with time complexity equivalent to 2^104 applications of the compression function (Muller, 2004). The author concludes, "MD2 can no longer be considered a secure one-way hash function". The MD5CRK distributed project is started with the aim of demonstrating that MD5 is practically insecure by finding a collision using a [birthday attack][BirthdayAttack]. [MD5CRK][MD5CRK] later announces collisions and their analytical attack reportedly took one hour on their hardware cluster.
| 2005/06 | Further exploits found in MD5. [Vlastimil Klima][VlastimilKlima] publishes an algorithm that can find an MD5 collision in one minute on a laptop, using a method he calls tunneling.
| 2008 | Preimage resistance of MD4 broken by GaÃ«tan Leurent, with a 2^102 attack. Time complexity later improved to 2^99.7 in 2010.
| 2009 | Time complexity of MD2's vulnerability is reduced to 2^63.3 compression function evaluations. Security updates were issued disabling MD2 in many software applications, most notably [OpenSSL][OpenSSL]
| 2010 | Tao Xie and Dengguo Feng announce the first published single-block (512-bit) MD5 collision. Not disclosing the attack method, they issue a challenge to the cryptographic community, offering a USD$10,000 reward to the first finder of a different 512-bit collision before 1/1/2013. Marc Stevens responds with numerous single-block messages along with the algorithm he used.
|| The [Software Engineering Institute (SEI)][SEI] considers MD5 "cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use"
| 2011 | [RFC-6150][RFC-6150] published by the IETF stating that MD4 is historic and obsolete.
|  | [RFC-6151][RFC-6151] published by the IETF updating security considerations for the use of MD5 - "The published attacks against MD5 show that it is not prudent to use MD5 when collision resistance is required."
| 2012 | [Flame malware][FlameMalware] exploits the weaknesses in MD5 to fake a Microsoft digital signature.

| Algorithm | Output    | Internal State | Block | Word | # Rounds
|:-         |:-         |:-              |:-     |:-    |:-
| MD2       | 128       | 384            | 128   | 32   | 18
| MD4       | 128       | 128            | 512   | 32   | 3
| MD5       | 128       | 128            | 512   | 32   | 64
| SHA256    | 256       | 256            | 512   | 32   | 64

#### Notes
* MD2 was considered a slow algorithm which can be attributed mainly to the fact that it used a large internal state relative to the hardware available at the time.
* MD4 was generally faster than MD2 but its vulnerabilities were quickly uncovered by researchers and members of the cryptographic community.
* In response to MD4's apparent weaknesses, Rivest designs MD5 which is more complex and difficult to break. The rest is history.

## Uses of MD5

Originally designed as a [cryptographic hash function][CryptographicHashFunction], MD5 has been found to have extensive vulnerabilities as outlined above and as such it is no longer reliable for cryptographic purposes. The function still has its uses today and is often used as a checksum to verify data integrity. It should be noted that MD5 is unsuitable for use in the verification of tramsmitted data (as per [RFC-6151][RFC-6151]), but it is very useful for verifying that local data has not become corrupt.
    
* USE for verifying that local data has not become corrupt, e.g. hashing data before compression and recording its hash value means that after decompression, the hash of the decompressed data can then be compared against the original hash. If the hashes match, it is very likely that the data has not been altered during the compression or decompression operations.

* DO NOT USE for verifying the integrity of data after transmission or possible handling by a third party, e.g. via HTTP, stored on a USB device or network. Since collisions are now relatively easy to create, it is possible for a man in the middle to alter the data in such a way that the hash of the original and modified data match. This is a very serious consideration in relation to malware.

## The MD5 Algorithm

### Terminology

In the previous comparison of a number of hashing algorithms, it could be seen that MD5 uses certain bit sizes for the core components of its algorithm.

| Algorithm | Output    | Internal State | Block | Word | # Rounds
|:-         |:-         |:-              |:-     |:-    |:-
| MD5       | 128       | 128            | 512   | 32   | 64

#### Output
The hash value produced by the algorithm which will always be 128 bits in length. In MD5 this is actually the modified initial internal state which is returned once all operations have been performed on it.

#### Internal State
This four-word buffer, composed of four 32-bit registers (A, B, C and D), should be initialised to the following hexadecimal values:

<center>

|Word   |Little Endian  | Big Endian    |
|:-:    |:-             |:-             |
|A      |01 23 45 67    |67 45 23 01    |
|B      |89 ab cd ef    |ef cd ab 89    |
|C      |fe dc ba 98    |98 ba dc fe    |
|D      |76 54 32 10    |10 32 54 76    |

</center>

#### Block
The input message is broken into chunks(blocks) of 512 bits in size. More on this is the Padding section.

#### Word
As outlined above, the internal state is maintained as a four-word buffer, i.e. 4 x 32-bit words to give an internal state size of 128 bits.

* Rounds - the number of rounds of calculations to be peformed in the algorithm 64 tounds are used here although it can also be thought of as 4 stages of 16 similar operations.

### Steps

#### Step 1 and Step 2 - Append Padding Bits and Length ([RFC-1321][[RFC-1321]] Section 3.1 & 3.2)

Since each block must be 512 bits in length, the original message may need to be padded so that its length is congruent to 448, modulo 512, i.e the entire length of the message should be padded to 64 bits short of being a multiple of 512 bits. Depending on the original length of the message, this may result in the need to add a new, fully padded block to the message.

Different approaches to apdding could be taken, e.g. the entire message could be pre-processed to determine total number of blocks and how they should be padded. In my implementation, I have performed padding on-the-fly to reduce the space complexity of the algorithm with no real impact on the time complexity.

(md5.c processNextMD5Block())

```vb
1. "Record the length of the original message."

    var messageLength = number of bits in original message represented as a 64-bit number**

2. "Append a single bit (one-bit) to the message."

    append one-bit (1) to the message

3. "Break the message up into blocks of 512 bits."

4. "Record the length of the last 512-bit block."

    var lastBlockLength = number of bits used in the last 512-bit block.

4. "Depending on the length of 'lastBlockLength', do one the following:"

    If lastBlockLength < 448 bits Then 
        
        pad with zero-bits until its length == 448 bits

        append `b` to the last block 
        
    End If

    If lastBlockLength == 448 bits Then append `b` to the last block End If
    
    If lastBlockLength > 448 AND messageLength < 512 bits Then
        
        append zero-bits (0) to last block until its length is 512 bits
        
        create a new block and pad with zero-bits until its length is 448 bits

        append 'b'

    End If
```
**In the unlikely event that b is greater than 2^64, then only
   the low-order 64 bits of b are used. These bits are appended as two
   32-bit words and appended low-order word first in accordance with the
   previous conventions. ([RFC-1321][RFC-1321] Section 3.2)

#### Step 3 - Initialise the Message Digest Buffer ([RFC-1321][RFC-1321] Section 3.3)

As described earlier in the [Internal State section](#Internal-State), each word in this four-word buffer should be initialised to constant values.

In my implementation of the algorithm I have used an alias for `uint32_t` which I have named `WORD`. Using this alias, I have created a `WORD` array named `H_MD5` to initialise and hold the internal state.

I have initialised `H_MD5` as follows (according to [RFC-1321][RFC-1321] Section 3.3):
    
        WORD H_MD5[] = { 0x67452301, 0xefcdab89, 0x98badcfe, 0x10325476 };

#### Step 4 - Process Message in 16-Word Blocks ([RFC-1321][RFC-1321] Section 3.4)
