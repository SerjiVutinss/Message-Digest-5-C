# Message-Digest-5-C
An implementation of the Message Digest 5 algorithm in C.

This document details how to compile and run the program. For more in-depth details... see OVERVIEW.md...HERE

## Project Brief

* Write a program in the C programming language that calculates the MD5 hash digest of an input. The algorithm is specified in the [Request For Comments 1321 document][RFC-1321] supplied by the [Internet Engineering Task Force][IETF].
* The program must perform the algorithm correctly  - it is up to the developer to decide which types of input the algorithm operates on, e.g. filename, string, url, etc.
